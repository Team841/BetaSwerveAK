This is Team 841's offseason robot code for the 2024 season. It implements the AdvantageKit logging framework, PathPlanner for autonomous routines, and WPILib's Command-Based programming for control.

This repository has two branches for our two offseason robots:

- Calliope Branch: Code for 2024 on-season robot.
- Nike Branch: Code for 2024 off-season clone of Calliope.
